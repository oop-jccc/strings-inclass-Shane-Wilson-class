### In-Class Programming Assignment: Create a Personalized Greeting

#### Objective
The goal of this assignment is to practice different string concatenation methods in C#. You'll be working with a `Person` class to format and display a personalized greeting.

#### Requirements

1. You are provided with a starter code that includes a `Person` class and a test class called `GreetingTests`.
2. Your task is to complete the test methods in `GreetingTests` to create a greeting using:
    - Plus Overload Operator (`+`)
    - `string.Concat`
    - `string.Format`
    - `StringBuilder`
    - String Interpolation (`$""`)


#### Expected Outcome

- Each test should pass if the greeting is correctly created.
- Each test should fail if the greeting is incorrect.

#### Tips

- You can use `Assert.AreEqual` to check if the concatenated string matches the expected string.
